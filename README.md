# Color Combinator 2025

## Generate 2, 3 or 4 color combinations
An open source tool which works in DrawBot.

## Project description
Choosing colors is a challenging task. Random combinations are a starting point, but often fail to match the desired tone.</br> 
This little tool allows you to quickly generate lots of color combinations.</br>  
Saturation and luminosity are selected using sliders, the hue is given a random value each time the program is run (repeat cmd r).

You can fix one or several generated colors and only update the others. The RGB and hex values are written to the console for use in other environments.
The tool is free and open source, developed in DrawBot with Python.</br>
